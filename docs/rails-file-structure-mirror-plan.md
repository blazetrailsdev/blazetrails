# Rails file-structure mirror — plan

Status: planning only. No code in this PR.

`scripts/api-compare/` validates that **methods exist** at the right
Rails-mirroring file paths. It does **not** validate **structure within a file**
— definition order, module nesting, public/private grouping, position of
`include` / `extend` / constants, or section comments. This plan designs a
data-driven ESLint rule (`blazetrails/rails-file-structure`) backed by a
cached Ruby analysis of `scripts/api-compare/.rails-source/`.

Style match: [activerecord-type-audit.md](activerecord-type-audit.md) +
[actionpack-restructure-audit.md](actionpack-restructure-audit.md).
This is the _within-file_ analog of the actionpack restructure audit.

The actionpack split matters for §3.1 path mapping — the package is itself a
union of Rails directories, so `conventions.ts` already disambiguates by
subdir.

**Rough estimate**: ~25% of files already close (≤5 reorder moves to match
Rails); ~50% partially aligned (5–20 moves); ~25% diverged enough that
re-sorting is mechanical-but-large. Visibility groupings are essentially
never preserved — Rails uses `private` keyword blocks; we use `@internal`
JSDoc plus underscore-prefix convention, with no contiguous block.

These are rough — the Ruby analysis pipeline in §2 produces the ground-truth
numbers and is what the wave plan is sized against.

## 2. The Ruby analysis pipeline

### 2.1 Extractor

Reuse the Ripper-based machinery already in
[`scripts/api-compare/extract-ruby-api.rb`](../scripts/api-compare/extract-ruby-api.rb).
The current extractor already captures namespaces, visibility, methods,
parameters, and dependency references; **structure data is mostly there,
just not emitted**. The new script adds:

- Per-method `line` (start) and `endLine`.
- Per-method `order` index _within its enclosing module_ (1-based).
- Module/class tree with start/end lines (not just dotted paths).
- `include` / `extend` / `prepend` directives — name, line, order.
- Constants — name, line, literal value when present.
- Section comments — runs of pure `#` lines preceded and followed by blank
  lines or method definitions. Captured as `{ line, text, followedBy: <next
method/include/const name> }` so the rule can locate "the comment that
  introduces section X" without doing fuzzy match.
- `attr_reader` / `attr_writer` / `attr_accessor` declarations — name, line,
  order (these are Ruby's analog of TS class fields).

Implementation sketch:

```ruby
# new file: scripts/rails-structure/extract-rails-structure.rb
# 1. Reuse PACKAGE_DIRS + walk() from extract-ruby-api.rb.
# 2. Hook process_def to record { name, visibility, line, endLine,
#    order_within_module }.
# 3. Hook on_module / on_class to record start_line, end_line, parent path.
# 4. Add on_command / on_command_call detection for `include X`,
#    `extend X`, `prepend X`, and `attr_*` (already partially handled).
# 5. Pre-pass over raw source for comment-block detection (Ripper's
#    on_comment fires per-line; group adjacent comment lines).
```

### 2.2 JSON cache shape

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2026-05-14T…",
  "railsSha": "<git rev of .rails-source>",
  "files": {

        {

          "kind": "module",
          "startLine": 5,
          "endLine": 920,
          "parent": null,
          "includes": [],
          "extends": [],

            {
              "kind": "method",
              "name": "save",
              "visibility": "public",
              "scope": "instance",
              "line": 250,
              "endLine": 270,
              "order": 1,
            },
            {
              "kind": "method",
              "name": "save!",
              "visibility": "public",
              "scope": "instance",
              "line": 272,
              "endLine": 290,
              "order": 2,
            },
            {
              "kind": "section",
              "text": "Internal callbacks",
              "line": 299,
              "followedBy": "destroy_associations",
            },
            {
              "kind": "method",
              "name": "destroy_associations",
              "visibility": "private",
              "scope": "instance",
              "line": 301,
              "endLine": 305,
              "order": 3,
            },
          ],
          "children": [{ "path": "ActiveRecord::Persistence::ClassMethods", "…": "…" }],
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

Flat `members` array with `order` is the central design decision: it lets
the ESLint rule produce O(n) diffs by walking members in declaration order
on both sides.

### 2.3 Cache location, regeneration, CI

- **Location**: `scripts/rails-structure/output/rails-structure.json`.
- **Committed**: **no** — generated locally, matching every existing
  Rails-derived manifest in the repo. Verified after a second Copilot
  pass: both `scripts/api-compare/output/rails-api.json` (gitignored at
  `scripts/api-compare/.gitignore`) and `eslint/rails-private-methods.json`
  (gitignored at `.gitignore:18`) are regenerated, not committed. There
  is no committed-cache precedent in this repo. Implications:
  - The ESLint rule must gracefully degrade when the cache is missing,
    exactly like `blazetrails/rails-private-jsdoc` does today — it
    consults `eslint/rails-private-methods.json` when present, otherwise
    treats the allowlist as empty rather than firing on every file.
  - First-run developers will see the structure rule as a no-op until
    they run `pnpm api:compare` (or the underlying
    `ruby scripts/api-compare/extract-ruby-api.rb` +
    `ruby scripts/rails-structure/extract-rails-structure.rb`). The rule
    prints a one-time "cache missing — run `pnpm api:compare`" diagnostic
    at startup.
  - Ruby remains a dev/CI dependency only, same as today.
- **Refresh trigger**: same gate as
  [`extract-ruby-api.rb`](../scripts/api-compare/extract-ruby-api.rb) lines
  16–28 — compare cache mtime to `.rails-source/.git/HEAD`, honour
  `API_COMPARE_FORCE=1`. Regeneration runs whenever the extractor is
  invoked, locally via `pnpm api:compare` or in CI via the explicit
  workflow step (next bullet).
- **CI integration**: verified against `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The
  default `lint` job (line 130) runs `pnpm lint` only — no Rails fetch,
  no Ruby — so the structure rule is a no-op there, exactly like
  `blazetrails/rails-private-jsdoc` is today. The job that actually
  enforces Rails-derived rules is **`rails-comparison`** (line 372),
  whose full step sequence at ci.yml:388–412 is: (1) fetch-rails.sh,
  (2) fetch-rails-tests.sh, (3) `ruby extract-ruby-api.rb`,
  (4) `ruby extract-ruby-tests.rb`, (5) `tsx extract-ts-api.ts && tsx
  compare.ts`, (6) `tsx compare.ts --privates`, (7) `tsx lint-deps.ts`,
  (8) `tsx build-rails-privates-manifest.ts && eslint packages/arel/src`,
  (9) test-compare. The Rails-derived ESLint gate is step 8; steps 5–7
  validate api:compare itself. The structure rule plugs in with two new steps
  inserted after `extract-ruby-api.rb`: (1) `ruby
extract-rails-structure.rb` → `output/rails-structure.json`, (2) `tsx
build-rails-structure-manifest.ts` → `eslint/rails-structure.cache.json`.
  The existing line-409 `eslint` invocation expands to cover all
  Rails-mirroring packages (not just `packages/arel/src`), picking up the
  new manifest. The structure rule's real gate is the `rails-comparison`
  job; this asymmetry with the default `lint` job is explicit and matches
  the existing precedent for `rails-private-jsdoc`.
- **Local dev**: extend `prelint` (`package.json:13`) to also run
  `tsx build-rails-structure-manifest.ts`. On a fresh clone before
  `pnpm api:compare` ever runs, the underlying `output/rails-api.json`
  and `output/rails-structure.json` won't exist; both manifest builders
  already handle that case (lines 56–62 of
  `build-rails-privates-manifest.ts` emit an empty manifest with a
  console warning). The new builder mirrors that handling.

### 2.4 Index for O(1) ESLint lookup

Two-layer file layout, with a clear boundary between **tooling artifacts**
(under `scripts/rails-structure/output/`, raw Ruby JSON for downstream
tools) and **runtime ESLint inputs** (under `eslint/`, the only files the
rule reads at lint time):

| file                                                  | producer                            | consumer                            | role                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `scripts/rails-structure/output/rails-structure.json` | `extract-rails-structure.rb`        | `build-rails-structure-manifest.ts` | tooling-only             |
| `eslint/rails-structure.cache.json`                   | `build-rails-structure-manifest.ts` | **ESLint rule (runtime)**           | per-file member lists    |
| `eslint/rails-structure.index.json`                   | `build-rails-structure-manifest.ts` | **ESLint rule (runtime)**           | TS-path → Rails-path map |

The ESLint rule never reads `scripts/rails-structure/output/` directly.
That keeps the rule's dependency surface to two stable JSON files,
co-located in `eslint/` alongside `rails-private-methods.json` so they
can't drift apart.

The index file:

```jsonc
{
  // keyed by TS-relative path, value is the entry to load lazily.
  "packages/activerecord/src/persistence.ts": "active_record/persistence.rb",
}
```

The ESLint rule loads `eslint/rails-structure.index.json` at construction
time and `eslint/rails-structure.cache.json` lazily on first violation,
both kept in module scope. It never touches the tooling JSON under
`scripts/rails-structure/output/`.

## 3. TypeScript-side analysis

### 3.1 Path & symbol mapping

Reuse the data encoded in
[`scripts/api-compare/conventions.ts`](../scripts/api-compare/conventions.ts):

- TS↔Ruby filename mapping (kebab→snake, `trailtie`↔`railtie`, package-root
  conventions).
- Method renames (`saveBang` ↔ `save!`, etc.).
- Symbol normalization for the api:compare matcher.

**Runtime constraint**: ESLint loads rules under Node without a TS loader,
and the repo ships no built `scripts/api-compare/conventions.js` artifact —
so the rule cannot `import` `conventions.ts` directly. Choose one of:

- **(a) JSON sidecar** — `pnpm api:compare` writes a pure-data
  `eslint/rails-conventions.json` (file map + rename map + package roots)
  alongside `rails-private-methods.json`. The rule reads this at startup.
  Pure data, zero runtime TS dependency. **Recommended.** Matches the
  data-driven pattern used by `blazetrails/rails-private-jsdoc`.
- (b) Move the helpers into a published package (e.g.
  `@blazetrails/api-compare-conventions`) so ESLint can import compiled
  JS. Heavier; only justified if other tooling needs the same logic.
- (c) Emit a small generated `eslint/rails-conventions.generated.mjs`
  alongside the cache. Same data, executable form. Slight runtime cost
  vs (a); no clear benefit.

Choosing (a). When `conventions.ts` gains a new rename, the next
`pnpm api:compare` run regenerates the JSON and the rule picks it up —
single source of truth preserved without runtime coupling.

### 3.2 TS analyzer — reuse `extract-ts-api.ts`

[`scripts/api-compare/extract-ts-api.ts`](../scripts/api-compare/extract-ts-api.ts)
already walks every Rails-mirroring package with the **TypeScript Compiler
API** (not `@typescript-eslint/parser`), produces a per-package cached
manifest under `output/ts-api-cache/<pkg>.json` keyed by a content
fingerprint, and is invalidated by a `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump. The structure
analyzer mirrors that design:

- New file: `scripts/rails-structure/extract-ts-structure.ts`, same Worker
  pattern, same `output/ts-structure-cache/<pkg>.json` layout, same
  `API_COMPARE_FORCE=1` escape hatch.
- The ESLint rule does **not** re-walk source from scratch on every lint
  invocation. It reads the cached structure manifest produced alongside
  `ts-api.json`. Per-file: O(1) cache lookup → O(n) member diff.
- For incremental editor lint, the rule falls back to a per-file ESLint AST
  walk if the cache entry is stale (mtime-newer-than-cache check); the walk
  uses the eslint TS parser AST that's already constructed for the file
  being linted, so the cost is only the visitor pass.

Per-file the analyzer collects, in source order:

- Top-level `import` statements.
- Top-level `export const`, `export function`, `export class`, `export
type`, `export interface`.
- For each class: method definitions, `static` blocks, field declarations.
- `include(Base, …)` calls from `@blazetrails/activesupport` (recognized
  by callee identifier — they are the Ruby-`include` analog).
- `this`-typed top-level `function` exports (the
  [CLAUDE.md mixin pattern](../CLAUDE.md)) — these mirror Ruby instance
  methods, not file-scope functions.
- JSDoc `@internal` markers (visibility analog).

The output is a TS-side `members` array with the same shape as the Ruby
side — `{ kind, name, visibility, order }` — which is then diffed against
the cached Ruby `members`.

### 3.3 Module-nesting strategy — decide once

Ruby files often look like `module ActiveRecord; module Persistence; module
ClassMethods; …; end; end; end`. We need to pick exactly one TS mapping
pattern and enforce it:

| option                                                                                                          | what it looks like                                                                              | pros                                                 | cons                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A. TS namespaces                                                                                                | `export namespace Persistence { export namespace ClassMethods { … } }`                          | structural 1:1                                       | non-idiomatic; namespaces are deprecated in modern TS; breaks tree-shaking; clashes with our current file-per-module convention |
| B. File-per-module, sibling files for nested modules                                                            | `persistence.ts` exports module-level; `persistence/class-methods.ts` exports the nested module | already what we do mostly; tree-shakable             | doesn't mirror within-file nesting at all                                                                                       |
| C. Hybrid — file is the outermost module; nested modules become **adjacent named exports** with a comment fence | `persistence.ts` has `// === ClassMethods ===` sections grouping exports                        | gives us a _positional_ mirror without TS namespaces | order-only mirror; not a true nesting check                                                                                     |

**Recommendation: B + C.** Adopt B as the structural convention (matches
current practice and `api-compare`'s file-path expectations), then layer C
on within files that contain multiple Ruby submodules. The ESLint rule
checks **within-file order** and treats sibling-file nesting as already
correct so long as the file path matches `conventions.ts`. Option A is
rejected — it would require a sweeping rewrite for no behavioural win.

## 4. Divergence catalogue

Inventoried from spot-checks against current code. Each divergence has a
**conformance rule** — where the TS-only content lives so the linter can
ignore it without false positives.

### 4.1 Worked example — `callbacks.ts` vs `callbacks.rb`

A concrete demonstration of what the analyzer produces. Trimmed for clarity:

**Ruby side** (`active_record/callbacks.rb`):

```
module ActiveRecord::Callbacks
  CALLBACKS = […]                       # constant, order 1
  include ActiveSupport::Callbacks      # include, order 2
  module ClassMethods                   # nested module
    def after_initialize(*, &block); …  # public, order 1
    def after_find(*, &block); …        # public, order 2
    def after_touch(*, &block); …       # public, order 3
  end
  def destroy                           # public instance, order 1
  def touch(*, **)                      # public instance, order 2
  private
  def create_or_update(**); …           # private, order 3
  def _create_record; …                 # private, order 4
end
```

**TS side** (`activerecord/src/callbacks.ts`):

```ts
export type CallbackOptions<…>          // type, order 1 (zero-cost; §4 row 2)
export function beforeValidation(…)     // helper, anchored to base.ts call site (§4 row 14)
export function afterValidation(…)
export function beforeSave(…)
…
```

**Diff produced by the analyzer**:

1. `CALLBACKS` constant: present in Ruby, absent in TS — Rails-only constant
   (callback names are `string[]` literals in TS). Not an error: constants
   with no TS counterpart are skipped (§4 row 11 generalized).
2. `include ActiveSupport::Callbacks`: present in Ruby, absent in TS — the
   wiring lives in `base.ts` via `include(Base, Callbacks)`. The rule
   reports this as an `include-position` finding on `base.ts`, not on
   `callbacks.ts`.
3. `destroy`, `touch`, `create_or_update`, `_create_record`: Ruby instance
   methods on the host. None of these are in `callbacks.ts` — they live in
   `persistence.ts` (`destroy`) and `core.ts` (`touch`). Cross-file:
   resolved via `conventions.ts` package-wide member index, then the rule
   checks position in those files instead.
4. `beforeValidation` / `afterValidation` / …: TS-side helpers without
   Ruby `def` counterparts. Treated by row 14: anchored to call sites in
   `base.ts` (`beforeValidation(this, …)`), not position-checked here.

Net: `callbacks.ts` produces zero position violations. The cross-file
resolution is the load-bearing piece. Mechanism: PR 2 emits a
**package-wide symbol → file** index (built by walking the cached TS
manifest), so when a Ruby method has no same-file TS counterpart the rule
asks the index "where does `destroy` live in package `activerecord`?" and
shifts the position check to that file. `moves.ts` is consulted only when
the host file itself is a documented merge or split — it does not need to
be touched for cross-file finds.

## 5. ESLint rule design

### 5.1 Rule

- **Name**: `blazetrails/rails-file-structure`.
- **Family**: data-driven, like `blazetrails/rails-private-jsdoc` and
  `blazetrails/nie-requires-annotation`. Reuses their plumbing in
  `eslint.config.mjs`.
- **Config schema**: `{ checks: ["method-order", "visibility-grouping",
"include-position", "module-nesting"], suppressFile?: boolean }`.
- **Severity**: per-check. `method-order` → warn-during-rollout, then
  error. `visibility-grouping` → warn permanently (high false-positive
  risk; see §7). `include-position` → error from day one (small surface).
  `module-nesting` → warn-only.
- **File-level suppression**: `/* eslint-disable
blazetrails/rails-file-structure */` works as usual. Also support a
  positive opt-out: a top-of-file
  `/** @rails-structure-skip reason="…" */` JSDoc, indexed by the rule for

The autofix uses ESLint's `fixer.replaceTextRange` over whole-statement
ranges; it cannot interleave or split statements. If two adjacent members
need to swap, the fix is one range covering both.

### 5.3 Performance

- Cache load: one JSON.parse on first violation, kept in module scope.
- **Parallel ESLint workers**: ESLint can run with `--concurrency`,
  spawning one worker per CPU. Each worker pays the JSON.parse cost
  independently. Mitigations: (a) ship a pre-built CommonJS module
  (`rails-structure.cjs`) that `require()` caches at V8 load time, (b) use
  per-file partitions so a worker only pays for entries it sees. With the
  index in §2.4, a worker that lints `persistence.ts` reads exactly one
  `active_record/persistence.rb` entry from a sharded JSON file
  (`output/by-file/active_record/persistence.json`). Recommendation: ship
  both the monolithic `rails-structure.json` (for tooling) and a sharded
  per-file directory (for the lint rule's hot path).
- Per-file: O(n) walk through the TS AST + O(n) diff against the cached
  Ruby `members` array. n is typically <200 per file.
- The index in §2.4 ensures path lookup is a single hash hit.

### 5.4 Integration

- `eslint.config.mjs` — add the rule to the same plugin object that
  registers `rails-private-jsdoc`, gated by glob to Rails-mirroring
  packages.
- The cache file is read at rule-construction time; if absent, the rule
  reports a single "cache missing — run pnpm api:compare" diagnostic
  rather than failing all files.
- Tests in `eslint/rails-file-structure.test.mjs` follow the
  `RuleTester` pattern used by sibling rules.

## 7. Risks + open questions

- **Hoisting / TDZ.** Auto-resort can move a `class Foo extends Bar`
  before `class Bar` is declared, or move a `const x = …` past a use
  site. The autofix MUST do a topological check (use TS's
  `findReferences`/scope analysis) before emitting a swap. Open question:
  do we accept the perf cost in-rule, or pre-compute a "safe to swap"
  bit in the cache by analyzing the Ruby side? Recommendation: skip
  swaps that cross any `class`/`function` declaration the AST flags as
  used before the proposed new position.
- **`include()` order matters at runtime.** Activesupport's `include()`
  manipulates the prototype chain in argument order. Reordering
  `include()` calls or moving them across method definitions can change
  behavior. PR 4's autofix is conservative here — it moves `include()`
  toward the Rails position only when no method definitions sit between
  source and target positions.
- **trails-tsc include() bridge ([PR #1150](https://github.com/blazetrailsdev/trails/pull/1150)).**
  The plugin emits interface-merges in source order. Method-order
  changes that re-sort `include()` callees can change the emitted
  interface declaration order. Behavior is identical (interface merges
  are commutative), but generated `.d.ts` snapshots drift — add a
  regen-snapshots step to the cleanup waves.
- **`@internal` markers** must be preserved across method moves. ESLint's
  fixer operates on text ranges, so as long as we include the leading
  JSDoc in the swap range, the markers stay attached. Add a unit test.
- **Rails source itself is inconsistent.** Some Rails files have methods
  in arbitrary order (e.g., `migration.rb` history). When the Ruby
  ground truth is non-canonical, the rule still reports diffs against
  it — by design. Suppression via `@rails-structure-skip
reason="rails-source-is-itself-disordered"` is the escape hatch and
  produces a tracked report.
- **Test files.** Out of scope (§8). They have no Ruby counterpart
  in a structure-preserving way (Minitest's structure ≠ Vitest's).
- **Cross-package symbols.** Methods that live in a different package
  than their Rails counterpart (e.g., the `Errors<T>` arc, certain Arel
  helpers) are caught by the path-map in `conventions.ts`. If the path
  map has no entry for a TS file, the rule skips it silently — that's
  the same behaviour as `api:compare` and is the right default.
- **Merged files.** Some TS files combine multiple Ruby files
  (`moves.ts`). The rule consults `moves.ts` and validates each chunk's
  internal order, but does not enforce inter-chunk ordering — chunk
  groupings stay as authors place them.
- **Ripper limitations.** Originally flagged here as a risk; verified
  resolved — `extract-ruby-api.rb` already handles `private(def foo)` in
  `process_method_add_arg` (line 491) by temporarily switching visibility
  and recursing into the nested `def`. No action needed; structure
  extractor inherits the behaviour by reusing `process_method_add_arg`.

## 8. Out of scope

- Actual file re-sorting cleanups (handled in PR 8+ cleanup waves).
- Test files (`**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.test-d.ts`).
- DX type tests (`packages/*/dx-tests/**`, `packages/*/virtualized-dx-tests/**`)
  — these pin TS public-type contracts and have no Ruby counterpart.
- Type-only files (`**/*.d.ts`).
- Generated files (`packages/*/dist/**`, fixture outputs).
- Files explicitly listed in
  [`scripts/api-compare/unported-files.ts`](../scripts/api-compare/unported-files.ts).
- Restructuring across files — the
  [actionpack restructure audit](actionpack-restructure-audit.md) covers
  inter-file moves; this plan is strictly within-file.
- Comment-content equality — only _positions_ of section comments are
  checked, never their text.
